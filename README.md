# Find Your Hat Node.js Game

This short game, written in JavaScript and run on Node.js, was created as a web development learning project on Codecademy.

## Game Objective

The objective of the game is for the user to "find their hat" by driving the * symbol (pathCharacter) to the ^ symbol (hat). 

The "O" character represents a hole in the field, and driving the * there results in Game Over. Stepping out of the bounds of the field also results in Game Over. 

Neutral ground on the field is represented by "â–‘", the "fieldCharacter". 

## Gameplay

A new instance of the Field class is created, and the user is prompted for directions to move the * symbol (i.e., up, down, left or right). 

The field is updated using the updateField method, leaving a trail of the * symbol along the path taken by the user.

## The generateField static method

As part of this project, a static method was written where a field was created based on user-input dimensions, along with a maximum percentage threshold of the number of holes that would appear on the field. 

"Field.generateField(5, 5, 0.3)" means that a 5x5 2-dimensional array field is created, containing one hat, one * to start, and randomly placed holes that shall not account for more than 30% of the field.
